# travel.

### About Our Application
travel. is an application that allows users to find city and route specific information, such as finding possible routes from a city to another (with stops in between), attractions in a certain city, recommendations, etc. 

### Directories
We have a couple of directories in our project. Our backend code is located in the server folder and our frontend code is located in the client folder. The SQL queries used for cleaning and creating the CityInfo and Routes tables is located in cleaningData.txt (in the dataCleaning folder of the server folder). The DDL for Attractions also located in cleaningData.txt, but the code used for creating the Attractions and AttractionsBackup tables are in the yelp folder which is also located in the dataCleaning folder.

### How To Run
In order to run the backend, after entering the server folder, npm start can be performed. The backend will be located on http://localhost:8080. 
For the frontend itself, routes.html can be run through VSCode's run feature. For our project in its entirety, we have deployed our application using Vercel, which our full project can be found at ...

### Dependencies
The only dependencies required are nodemon and npm for the backend.
